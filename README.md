## Simple Web Scraper

# Python and BeautifulSoup

This is a simple web scraping project using Python's BeautifulSoup. We use the following website to scrape for jobs:
[https://www.timesjobs.com/candidate/job-search.html?searchType=personalizedSearch&from=submit&txtKeywords=python&txtLocation=]
(https://www.timesjobs.com/candidate/job-search.html?searchType=personalizedSearch&from=submit&txtKeywords=python&txtLocation=)

and as seen we apply a filter for all Python programming jobs, which we then save individually as txt files inside the **posts** folder.
